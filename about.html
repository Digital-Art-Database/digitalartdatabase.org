    <h2>WHAT IS DIGITAL ART?</h2>
    <p>Digital art is used as an umbrella term, and generally covers the broad category of things created at the intersection of art and technology, although there are different terms and subcategories for this, including New Media Art, Generative Art, and Computer Art, to name a few.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>WHY CREATE THE DIGITAL ART DATABASE?</h2>
    <p>The Digital Art Database (DADB) is a place that collects and curates different forms of Digital Art and events from a range of different artists, companies, and collectives, to be able to have everything stored in one place. This idea to create a website/database stemmed from the frustration of having different things stored in different places, in the form of spreadsheets, bookmarks, articles, and various other places, so to eliminate that problem, this website stores everything from various sources in one easily accessible place.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>NFTS, JAVASCRIPT HEAVY WEBSITES, AND SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
    <p>Whilst there are some artists listed on this database that do NFTS and/or have Javascript heavy websites, we are aware of the impact that these things have on the environment. We personally want to remain as low tech as possible, so that this is accessible to everyone, and not just to those who happen to have the most powerful devices. We are also aware of the environmental impact that NFTs have, and until there is a genuinely sustainable solution to blockchain, we do not encourage the use of NFTs, despite listing artists that do it. This is the artist's own responsibility, and we are not accountable for their actions.</p>
